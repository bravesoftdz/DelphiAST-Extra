# DelphiAST-Extra
Additional features for the DelphiAST Library (primarily the "Symbol Tree")

# Prerequisites (Dependencies):
DelphiAST-Extra requires the DelphiAST library in order to function.

It is kept up-to-date with [the LaKraven Fork of DelphiAST](https://github.com/LaKraven/DelphiAST), so if you wish to ensure full functionality then it is recommended that you obtain [the LaKraven Fork of DelphiAST](https://github.com/LaKraven/DelphiAST). This Fork is synchronized periodically, once all projects (both public and private) utilizing the DelphiAST have been tested against the newest revision.

Note that [the LaKraven Fork of DelphiAST](https://github.com/LaKraven/DelphiAST) typically does not contain any custom additions or modifications, it is merely the "most recent confirmed codebase" taken from [the original DelphiAST library](https://github.com/RomanYankovsky/DelphiAST).

[The original DelphiAST Library](https://github.com/RomanYankovsky/DelphiAST) is a product of [Roman Yankovsky](mailto:roman@yankovsky.me), with contributions from others in the Delphi community.
